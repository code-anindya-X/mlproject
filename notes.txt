setup function
The setup function is a special function in the setuptools library that is used to define the metadata and dependencies of a Python package. It takes several keyword arguments to configure the package, including:

name: The name of the package
version: The version number of the package
author and author_email: The author's name and email address
packages: A list of packages to include in the distribution (usually found using find_packages())
install_requires: A list of dependencies required by the package
The setup function is typically called once in the setup.py file of a Python package, and is used to generate the package's metadata and distribution files.
